	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	I have always been interested in the human body and how it works. As a small child my father would often find me with our Encyclopedia Britannica open at the “human body” section. My parents always thought I would be a doctor but as I got older I learnt that what interests me is how our bodies respond to food.
	</p>
	<p>
	I spent many years “dieting” trying to find the perfect fit for me. Whenever I was eating great healthy food I always felt great no matter what the number on the scales read. This lead me to realise that what we eat has a great influence on not only how we look but also how we perform and how we feel, and how we feel is more important than the number on the scales.

	<p>
I spent over 5 years in the weight loss industry helping people achieve and maintain their weight loss goals. It was very rewarding to see the impact balanced eating had on people’s lives but I wanted to understand more. I spent time at University learning the biochemistry of our bodies then furthered my formal education specialising in nutrition.

	With a BSc in biochemistry and a Graduate Diploma in human nutrition I am well qualified and I look forward to working with you to achieve your nutrition goals.
